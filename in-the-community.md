# In the Community

West Shore Physiotherapy is committed to being an active member of the Innisfil and Alcona community. We currently sponsor the local Innisfil Winterhawks PeeWee A hockey team for the 2013-2014 season. We are always looking for more ways to get involved. Please feel free to contact about us other opportunities. Please visit the Innisfil Minor Hockey League website for more information on this organization - [http://www.innisfilminorhockey.com/league/](http://www.innisfilminorhockey.com/league/).
