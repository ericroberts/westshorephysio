# What to Expect

## What to Expect on Your First Visit

When arriving for your first visit, please arrive 10 minutes prior to your appointment time. This will ensure you will have sufficient time to complete all necessary new patient health information forms. These forms are required to be completed for our records before any treatment can begin. During your initial visit, you will be introduced to the Physiotherapist on Staff. During your one on one assessment with the Physiotherapist, your medical history and an account of what occurred preceding the injury will be discussed. Your assessment will include an extensive biomechanical assessment of your injury and may include an evaluation of movement patterns, gait,  strength, joint range of motion, reflexes, and sensation. In addition, the Physiotherapist may examine relevant xrays, laboratory tests, medical records and surgical notes. Based on this assessment, the Physiotherapist establishes a diagnosis and will explain your injury to you. A treatment plan will then be formed based on a discussion of your goals of recovery and you will be guided through the exercises needed for your recovery in a supervised environment. Physiotherapy treatment can include therapeutic exercises such as strengthening and stretching, manual therapy, acupuncture, electrical modalities such as TENS, , IFC, ultrasound and laser therapy.

## How long is each Treatment?

Treatments can vary in length depending on the type of injury. On average, an initial assessment will take 45 to 60 minutes and each treatment will take 30-45 minutes. Please let Staff know if you have any time constraints before the appointment begins to ensure you are accommodated.

## Do I need a Referral from my Doctor to Make a Physiotherapy Appointment?

A referral is not required to make an appointment with a physiotherapist and receive treatment. Extended health insurance companies require a doctorâ€™s prescription in order for you to be eligible to be reimbursed.

## What if I need to cancel an Appointment?

West Shore Physiotherapy requires 24 hours notice if a patient must cancel or change an appointment. This ensures that other patients who require treatment can be seen in your place. There is a $25 cancellation fee if 24 hours notice is not given.
