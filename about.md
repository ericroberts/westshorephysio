# About Us

## Our Story

West Shore Physiotherapy opened its doors in July 2013. Owner, Kyle Murphy, moved to the area with his wife in early 2012 and recognized the need for a high quality, client-focused physiotherapy clinic. After practicing in a small office in The Lakeside Clinic for a few months, Kyle made the move to open his own Clinic in the Crossroads Plaza only a few doors down. The Clinic has experienced overwhelming support and we are excited to be a part of the Alcona community. Please feel free to call us to book your initial assessment.
